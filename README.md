# Falling Rust

A falling-sand toy written using Rust, Bevy and egui.

[Read more about it on my blog](https://www.basvs.dev/projects/falling-rust).

## How to run

A release version for Windows is available at [GitHub releases](https://github.com/grunnt/falling-rust/releases).

## How to run from the code

You will need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) installed to compile this. 

The simulation is quite CPU intensive, so make sure to run this in release mode:

```
cargo run --release
```
